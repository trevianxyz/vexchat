TIPS AND TRICKS FOR STARTING THE YEAR WITH VEX

By Alaina Caulkett

August 25, 2022

The ‘back to school’ season is often filled with many different things – excitement for the year ahead, optimism for the learning opportunities, eagerness to meet your new students, as well as trepidation about a vast array of unknowns, anxiety about new materials or initiatives, and everything in between. The ever growing ‘to do’ list can seem overwhelming, but a great thing about the VEX PD+ Community is that we can support one another and share our own experiences as educators to help everyone feel empowered and excited to teach. In this article you will find tips and tricks for each VEX platform so you know you will be ready to get started teaching in your VEX Classroom.

No matter what you are teaching, your year will start off with setting routines with your students. Aimee DeFoe, Senior Education Developer, covers ways to make teaching classroom procedures and routines fun in the Back to School Doesn’t Mean Back to Boring video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/back-to-school-doesnt-mean-back-to-boring].

Keep the excitement going and use some of the research-based recommendations from Jason McKenna, Director of Global Education Strategy, on how to keep students engaged through challenges in the Connecting Research and Teaching - Student Engagement video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/connecting-research-and-teaching-student-engagement].

VEX IQ

Activities are a great way to get started with your students without diving into a classroom competition. Watch the Using VEX IQ Activities video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/using-vex-iq-activities] for more information on how to get started. 

Activities made to help you start the year off: 

 * Introduce the Kit to your students with the Scavenger Hunt [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_-KPn_RCwQOuDbinaMxHU2VMIjY-TKd7pHV6SGLpHc/edit] 
 * Practice building structures with Hang Out [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rnpQ1VDEIH3lhpHp8fl-YybA034D73LZIz_rRy6mufc/edit#]

After students are familiar with VEX IQ pieces and the kits, have them build their first robot! Use the Building Your First Robot video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/building-your-first-vex-iq-2nd-gen-robot] if students need additional guidance or tips while building.

VEX EXP

VEX EXP Kits have many components, so it’s important that students understand the different parts of the Kit and how they work together. I recommend starting the year off using activities like the Scavenger Hunt [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6fM6uu95Akg-KNJ2O6kpXMsOYWwjq9a1CoMQRBTrK0/edit#] to make sure students are familiar with the kit. 

You can also use a video like EXP Hardware [https://pd.vex.com/videos/vex-exp-hardware] to discuss some of the different components and how they work together to connect things like C-Channels, shafts, etc. 

After students are familiar with VEX EXP pieces and the kits, have them build their first robot! Use the Building Your First Robot video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/building-your-first-robot?playlist=get-started-with-vex-exp&page=0] if students need additional guidance or tips while building.

VEXCODE VR

 * Best Practices for Getting Started with Your VEX 123 Bundle [https://pd.vex.com/videos/best-practices-for-getting-started-with-your-123-bundle]

VEXcode VR activities are a great way to get your students working on self-directed challenges. See this video to learn more about using VEXcode VR activities. [https://pd.vex.com/videos/using-vexcode-vr-activities]

Because all of these activities are completed in VEXcode VR on a device, it is good practice to get your students to be active in their learning. In the Making VEXcode VR an Active Learning Experience video [https://pd.vex.com/videos/making-vexcode-vr-an-active-learning-experience], you can learn how to get students engaged through planning projects, practicing concepts, reflecting on and extending their learning in off-screen and physically active ways while using VEXcode VR as a learning tool.
